## About

Welcome to **Building My Personal Brand â€“ Sreeja Pulaparty: Branding and AI** âœ¨

This repository showcases the creative and strategic journey behind building my personal brand as a graduate student specializing in **Branding, Storytelling, and AI**. Through this project, I explored how to define, visualize, and present a distinctive identity that reflects both technical skills and creative voice.

### What's Inside:
- **Brand Storytelling Arcs**: Narrative frameworks used to structure my brand.
- **Pitch Deck**: Concise and compelling summary of my brand identity and value proposition.
- **Research & Strategy**: Insights from personal branding, LinkedIn audits, and audience targeting.
- **Visual Identity**: My custom logo, color palette, and typography guidelines.
- **Wireframes**: Foundational layouts and structure of my portfolio website.

This project was created for the **INFO7375: Branding & AI** course at Northeastern University, blending design thinking, strategic branding, and AI fluency. It reflects my core values: **creativity, clarity, and curiosity**.

Letâ€™s build brands that think. ðŸ¤–âœ¨
